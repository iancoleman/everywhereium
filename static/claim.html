                Here to claim a tip? Make sure you've done this first:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add a <a href="/the_tip_property">tip property</a> to the body tag of your page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                When you've done that,
                put the url of your website in the form below.
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="text" id="url">
            </div>
            <div>
                Everywhereium will look for the tip property in the body tag of the page. If it's there, any tips being held at everywhereium for that site will be sent to the address in the body tag. Please be aware, it might take up to two working days for the tips to be forwarded on to your address.

                <button id="claim" class="btn">Claim</button>
            </div>
            <div>If you've seen that your page has been read correctly in the feedback below, resubmitting the form will not cause your tips to be sent any faster!</div>
