        <div>Add a 'tip' property to a div tag or the body tag on your page.</div>
        <div>
            <code>
                &lt;div tip="<a href="/the_tip_property">your details here</a>"&gt;Your content&lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
        </div>
        <div>
            This lets everyone on the internet know how they can send you tips.
        </div>
        <div>See what the <a href="/the_tip_property">tip property</a> should include and <a href="/the_tip_property">generate</a> a tip tag for your elements.</div>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Use any payment method - currently <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/everywhereium/mflpjfialafgelfklkbobnmjjkigfeij">the everywhereium extension</a> supports bitcoin and paypal.</li>
                <li>Supports multiple tips per page - each indivdual content contributor can be tipped; works well on forums and crowd-sourced content.</li>
                <li>Easily expanded - json format has been designed for flexibility so other payment methods can easily be included, even before they're supported in the browser extensions.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium">Open source</a> - secure and community-driven</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Giving Tips</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/everywhereium/mflpjfialafgelfklkbobnmjjkigfeij">Install the extension</a> (currently chrome only, others are in the works)</li>
                <li>If you like something on a page, press the extension button.</li>
                <li>The extension looks for tip data, and presents a simple dialog.</li>
                <li>Use the dialog to send a tip directly to the person that created the content you like.</li>

            <h1>FAQ</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Why does this page look so horrid?</li>
                <div>Everywhereium is looking for a person to do some styling. If you can create some graphics and do some
                    css, please visit the project at
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium">github.com</a> and have a look at the issues
                    list, particularly the issue about <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium/issues/1">style</a>.
                    Of course, tip data for contributors will be included on any page they contribute to.</div>

                <li>When will extensions be available for browsers other than chrome?</li>
                <div>When they get written! If you know code, please consider contributing to the project at
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium">github.com</a>
                    There's also opportunity to create javascript libraries and wordpress plugins etc that can also
                    tap into the tip property.
                    See the issues about the
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium/issues/3">Firefox extension</a>, the
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium/issues/4">Internet Explorer extension</a>, and the
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium/issues/5">javascript library</a>.
                </div>

                <li>What if I want to tip a page that has no tip data on it?</li>
                <div>Everywhereium is investigating an escrow service so you can still send a tip to that page,
                    and the owner of the page can claim it back when they've added the required tip
                    information to their page. If you have a good idea, please make a comment in the
                    forum thread
                    or the
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedawnrider/everywhereium/issues/2">github issue</a>.
                </div>

                <li>How can I contact everywhereium?</li>
                <div>The best means of contacting everywhereium is by email. ian@everywhereium.com</div>
